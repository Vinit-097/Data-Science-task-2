# Titanic Dataset – Data Cleaning & Exploratory Data Analysis

This project is a self-learning data science task focused on data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and basic model training using the Titanic dataset.

## Objective
To clean the dataset, explore relationships between variables, identify patterns and trends, and gain insights related to passenger survival.

## Dataset
Titanic dataset from Kaggle.

## Tools & Libraries Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

## What was done
- Loaded and inspected training and test datasets
- Handled missing values for age, fare, and embarked columns
- Encoded categorical variables such as sex and embark location
- Removed irrelevant columns to simplify analysis
- Performed EDA using histograms for age and fare distributions
- Trained a Logistic Regression model to understand survival patterns

## Visualizations
- Age distribution of passengers
- Fare distribution of passengers

## Learning Outcome
This project helped me understand the importance of data cleaning and EDA in machine learning workflows and how insights can be derived before model building.
